- [ ] Ensure DNS A record points to this VPS IP
- [ ] Test domain resolution: `nslookup your-domain.com`

## Application Deployment
- [ ] Logout and login again (for Docker group permissions)
- [ ] Deploy: `cd /home/jay_gatsby/mernvps && docker compose up -d`
- [ ] Check logs: `docker compose logs`
- [ ] Test API: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`
- [ ] Test external: `curl https://your-domain.com/api/health`

## Security Verification
- [ ] SSH key authentication only (disable password auth)
- [ ] Firewall only allows SSH, HTTP, HTTPS

- [ ] CORS configured for your frontend domain

## Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up automated backups: `crontab -e`
- [ ] Add: `15 2 * * * /home/jay_gatsby/mernvps/scripts/mongo_backup.sh`
- [ ] Test backup script manually
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)

## Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] API responds to health check
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] CORS allows frontend requests
- [ ] TLS certificate is valid
- [ ] Backup script runs successfully
- [ ] Logs are being written properly

## Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Check services
sudo systemctl status caddy
docker compose ps
sudo ufw status

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u caddy -f
docker compose logs api
docker compose logs mongo

# Test connectivity
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```
